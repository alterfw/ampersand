        title: Router
        icon: plane
        description: |
            Ampersand provides a simple router built in the WordPress rewrite API that maps
            route callbacks to specific HTTP request
            methods and URIs.

        title: HTTP
        icon: exchange
        description: |
            Ampersand has easy-to-use request and response abstractions
            that let you inspect and manipulate
            HTTP messages' method, status, URI, headers, cookies, and body.

        title: Templates
        icon: file-text
        description: |
            Ampersand uses Twig as built-in as template engine, so you can create
            powerful templates using layouts, template blocks, etc.

        icon: database
        description: |

            a model-binding system to WordPress Post Types and Taxonomies.
